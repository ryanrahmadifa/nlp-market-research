Leveraging  NLP,  the  market  research  process  was  done  significantly  faster resulting  in  coherent  and  insightful  results.  NLP  on  the  news  data  show  that  the  EV industry has massive governmental support which coincides with the integrated mobility mode  of  MaaS  developed  by  the  government.  With  the  general  public  supporting  this ecosystem of integrated mobility, the best choice for an EV company is to work together with the Indonesian government to reduce carbon emission and make the mobility of the people  electricity  based.  

Applications  based  on  ride-hailing  and  ride-sharing  business models are not only focused on the transportation aspect of mobility but also enabling other quality of life features such as food deliveries. Most users are concerned with said other features which might drive the developers to focus on making other customizable features, instead of focusing on mobility and its consequences toward the environment. Idea  generation  takes  all  that  data a  step  further  to  give  three  alternatives  for  strategic plans and three MaaS packages for the management to discuss upon. By using state-of- the-art  libraries  for  NLP  and  Python  as  a  base  for  automation  of  every  process  in  the pipeline, this essay has proven that an end-to-end automated market research pipeline is possible and has enormous potential for real-world use cases.
